Tmux pomodoro
=================

This plugin is WIP a lot of options are currently hard coded and documentation is non-existent.

I'll update the readme and file some issues for remaining action I need to take to make this usable
for the outside world.

The short gest is that by adding `#{pomodoro_status}` to your tmux status line, you get the ability to start `prefix-p` or stop `prefix-shift-p` a pomodoro. The pomodoro has a default length of 25 minutes.
